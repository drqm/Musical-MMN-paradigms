# Musical MMN paradigms
In this folder you wil find the scripts necesary to create and implement musical multifeature mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigms. The folder "functions" includes the functions "mumufe_create" and "mumufe_record", which randomize tone sequences and make audio examples, respectively. The utility script "rename_tones" is also included, to facilitate the manipulation of sounds. 

An implementation of one of the variants of the paradigms, the no-standard paradigm, is also included in the folder "mumufe_implementation". A wrapper script to pass arguments to the "mumufe_create" function is provided, as well as text files with the sequences of tones and Presentation scripts to deliver the sequences. The tones used for this particular implementation are included in the folder "tone_pool".
